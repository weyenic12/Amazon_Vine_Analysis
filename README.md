## Overview of the Analysis
- The goal of our analysis is to find out if 5 star reviewers are more likely to be from the Amazon Vine program or if they are to be regular customers who were unpaid for their 5-star reviews.
- The dataset I chose was the video games dataset as I was interested to see if Amazon Vine reviewers were reviewing video games with 5 star ratings.
--------------------------
## Results
- I created tables, which can be found in the images folder, and reviewed the dataset and filtered all the reviews down to just the 5 star reviews. After reviewing the results, I found that there were 631 5-star reviews 1685 total reviews. Unfortunately for me and my analysis, there were zero reviews placed by Amazon Vine members regardless if they were 5-stars or not. This leading to an obvious 100% of 5-star reviews placed by non-Vine members.
--------------------------
## Summary
- I chose a dataset that unfortunately had zero vine reviews and thus my analysis on Amazon Vine reviews cannot be found. It would be better to verify after choosing a dataset and creating tables that the dataset does have Vine reviews to see the correlation.
